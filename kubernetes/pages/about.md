Hi there! My name is Álex. I am an IT guy with passion on development and nowadays in infrastructure as well since Docker, Kubernetes and others happened.

On my day to day job I work as software architect for  [jobandtalent.com](https://jobandtalent.com). I came to work here (Madrid) in October 2015 after expending some years in London (UK) and in Groningen (NL).

My name is Ivan. I consider myself a developer who swims the chopy waters of DevOps. Kubernetes and containers are my daily Jam. I love APIs, and I do not care about languages anymore. I do Java, Python, Go and maybe Javascript in a daily basis.

I like to make stuff, from furniture for children to lamps or anything with wheels that can be pushed, dragged or propulsed.

Currently working as a devops engineer at the [UK Home Office](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/home-office).
