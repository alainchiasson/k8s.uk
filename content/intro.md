Kubernetes, a blog
======================

One of the things that I really missed during my journey to Docker was to have a place to put all the notes, posts and leassons learnt... which end up scattered all over gists, posts and text files all over the place.

Now with Kubernetes I thought... perhaps I should start being a bit more organised, and since I "had" to register this domain, I thought, you know what, it would be great if apart from me, anyone else could contribute to it.
rsome, so, I decided to go for a very open attempt.

So, if you want to publish a post in this blog, just fork and send a PR!

Let's make the Kubernetes community even more awesome!
