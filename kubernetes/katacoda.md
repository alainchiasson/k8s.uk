Kubernetes Play
==========================

Recently we were talking about building a kubernetes cluster to let people play and familiarise with Kuberentes. However, building such cluster is not an easy task. Security was our main concern. Not because kubernetes is not secure enough, but because having a kubernetes cluster exposed to the public could be dangerous.

While thinking of the different aspects we should cover and build I remembered a website called "[Katacoda](https://www.katacoda.com)" where you could learn Docker. I went there and sure enough, Ben had built a [Kubernetes playground](https://www.katacoda.com/courses/kubernetes)!!!

So, if you want to familiarise with Kubernetes, I strongly advise you to go there and follow the different tutorials. The great thing about Katacoda is that you do not need anything special, just a good old browser (not too old, please).
