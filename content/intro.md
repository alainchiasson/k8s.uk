Kubernetes, a blog
======================

I was thinking about writing a few posts about kubernetes but then I realised that it would be much better if I could open that to anyone wanting to share their experiences with the blue scheduler. Blog systems are cumbersome, so, I decided to go for a very open attempt.

So, if you want to publish a post in this blog, just fork and send a PR!

Let's make the Kubernetes community even more awesome!
